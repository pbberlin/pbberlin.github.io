### [Private debt survey](https://github.com/zew/go-questionnaire)

A large private debt broker commissioned a survey of private capital lending from us in October.

This brings the number of surveys realized using my software [go-questionnaire](https://github.com/zew/go-questionnaire) to nine.

* European Union policy
* Macro multiplicators in economics
* Financial literacy
* Policy of State governments
* European Union reform

* Financial Markets Survey
* Paternalism in politics
* Green Finance
* Retirement saving 

Many thousand survey questions were answered by members of parliament from France, Italy, Germany, the EU; from mayors and state parliaments (Italy, Germany) and from academic researchers from all EU member states.

So far, no data has been lost, no data got corrupted and the software never crashed.

I could never have done this without the amazing productivity of the [Go language](https://go.dev/). The ideas behind it are outlined by [Rob Pike here](https://commandcenter.blogspot.com/2012/06/less-is-exponentially-more.html)

### [Mass mailing](https://github.com/zew/go-massmail)
